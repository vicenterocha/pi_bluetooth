# Pi Bluetooth

Automatically connects to my s10 and redirects audio to jack. 
The raspberry is in my car, so I don't need to plug the jack to my s10, the bluetooth connection is automatically setup and the music is started.
In 30 seconds I'm listening to whatever I was last listening (either on the music or podcast player).

## TODO
Create a tutorial, because some files need to be changed and are not mentioned here.
