# Pi Bluetooth

Automatically connects to my s10 and redirects audio to jack. 
The raspberry is in my car, so I don't need to plug the jack to my s10, the bluetooth connection is automatically setup and the music is started.
In 30 seconds I'm listening to whatever I was last listening to (either on the music or podcast player).

## Buttons Controller 

I also built a controller using pushbuttons and the GPIOs of rasperry. They allow me play/pause, previous and next. An extra and experimental button, when pressed twice reads the name of the song outloud.

Create a tutorial, because some files need to be modified and are not mentioned here.
